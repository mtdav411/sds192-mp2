## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```


```{r}
president <- candidates %>% filter(cand_office=="P") %>% select(cand_name,cand_party_affiliation,cand_election_yr,cand_state)

```
